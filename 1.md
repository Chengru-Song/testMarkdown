# Dreamua Technical Document


---

## 1.Introduction
Our Dreamua application's backend is totally based on Node.js which is a framework derived from Javascript programming language. It is worth noting that **Everything in Javascript is asynchronous.** Therefore the design patterns in Node.js is completely different from classical OOP programming languages. **Dreamua** utilizes the advantage of Functional Programming and the whole system is divided into minimal functions which will be composed together later using **Compose** technologies in Javascript.

## 2.Database Design
We use the famous Nosql Mongodb for our system. Nosql is famous for its flexibility in document and querying speed when compared with traditional RDBMS. It is perfectly suitable for an application which need to embrace updates and changes over a short period of time. Through the first iteration of our prototype, we recognize the customer demand and model our system by the following functionalities: 
| ID         | Action   |  How to Demo  |
| :--------   | :-----:  | :----  |
| 1          | Login |   Enter Edu email address on home page and click Login button. If the user has already registered then he's asked to enter his password or else the page will jump to verification code page and the user needs to enter the verification code that's just been sent to his Edu email.    |
| 2        |   Change Info   |   First time login or click on the user's avatar on **Mine** page, the user will be able to change his avatar or sex or password. |
| 3        |    AI match    |  On main page, type a sentence less than 30 words(default last time sentence) to match a person, the action will take you to the chatroom with a person when completes.  |
| 4 | Chat | On chat page, the user can chat with the person through plain text, voice messages, pictures and Emojis.|
| 5 | Detail | The user click on the avatar of the person in chatroom, after which the page will jump to details of the person.|
| 6 | Stick on Top | In detail page the user could stick the person on top of the chat list.|
| 7 | Block | In detail page the user could block the person from sending messages to him. If he is already blocked, he can revoke the action. |
| 8 | Chat list | In chat page, the chat list following a timeline of people. | 
| 9 | View Avatar | Click on the image of the person to view the avatar. |
| 10 | Add friend | In personal information page you can add the person as friend. |
Therefore we model our system into the following diagram:
![database](database.png)  

Since the data stored in the database is in document form, so it is easy to extend. 

## 3.Class Diagram
Our class design will stick to MVC framework which means our controller part is responsible for all business logic. At the same time, models are in charge of the core functions such as get users from the database. As for the view part, the backend system is completely based on RESTful API for various frontend solutions.

The framework design is shown in the following picture:
